## Next Steps

Once you've saved the unified `README.md` and finished resolving the `.gitignore` conflict:

1.  **Stage both files** to mark the conflicts as resolved:

    ```bash
    $ git add .gitignore README.md
    ```

2.  **Commit the merge** to finalize the `git pull`:

    ```bash
    $ git commit -m "Merge remote main branch with local history, resolving initial conflicts in .gitignore and README"
    ```

3.  **Push the unified history** to GitHub:

    ```bash
    $ git push -u origin main
    ```
